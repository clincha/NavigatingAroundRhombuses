# Navigating around Rhombuses

### Introduction
You will receive an automatic e-mail which contains a pdf document, that is individual to you, which includes a table. 
This table will give the vertices of your 16 rhombuses.
The document will also contain 12 navigation puzzles. 
Your mission, is to generate solutions for each of the 12 problems. 
Each solution should be written to a separate output file and placed in the submission directory detailed below. 

E.g. For a puzzle navigating between (17, 21) and (0, 3), you will need to generate 7.txt which contains either:

`(17, 21) (22, 16) (22, 15) (19, 1) (3, 1) (0, 3)`

or any other sequence of line segments which connects coordinate (17, 21) to (0, 3).

### Marking
Twelve marks will be awarded for a correction solution to each problem and a further twelve marks will
be awarded for optimal solutions, that is, solutions that minimise the number of line segments. In addition
to placing the 12 solutions in the submission directory, you will also need to submit the source code used
to generate your solutions; without providing the code itself no marks be will be awarded for the solutions
themselves.
